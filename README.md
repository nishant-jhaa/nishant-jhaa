- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nishant-jhaa a Researcher, a Programmer and a Gamer. I'm well versed in Blockchain development, Machine Learning and its Applications, Game Development. I'm also having a good knowledge of microcontrollers and microprocessors.
- I'm currently doing research primarily in the fields of blockchain, Machine learning and intersection of blockchain and machine learning. I do not post much projects on github as most of my projects are research based and can not be put over open source platforms like github. Also, I have to file patents for my projects so thse can't be uploaded on github.
